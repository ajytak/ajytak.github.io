  const currentFocus = `I'm a Robotics graduate student at Georgia Tech with a background in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Bombay. My current focus is on agile robotics, developing control and learning methods that enable dynamic, fast, and responsive behavior in physical systems. I'm particularly interested in approaches that generalize across tasks and environments, motivated by the belief that solving the challenges of agile control leads to solutions applicable to a wide range of robotics problems. My broader interests include learning-based control, sim-to-real transfer, and decision-making for high-performance autonomous systems.`;
